	<h3>Goals of this Talk</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>What problems do VCS solve?</li>
		<li>What are the benefits of Helix (Perforce)?</li>
		<li>What are the benefits of Git?</li>
		<li>What are the trade-offs of each model?</li>
		<li>Would we want to use Git for games?</li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		This is a weird talk, it's meant to inspire discussion and thought more than anything else.

		Some of you may or may not be aware of what Git is. I really hope you know what Perforce is by now.

		"Git" is a source control management system that has become incredibly popular for a wide variety of reasons in
		recent years. Some of these reasons are good, and while it's my personal preferred versioning system of choice
		for personal projects, there are very good reasons why even though most tech companies now use Git, the games
		industry still mostly uses traditional systems like Perforce. However, there are a few signs to indicate that
		this might start changing, as tools are being developed to solve the problems that Git introduces. However,
		these solutions naturally come with their own problems, especially in terms of their complexity.

		So part of the goal of this talk is to really start a discussion about whether or not this complexity is worth it,
		but in order to have the discussion, we need to understand the chain of problems and solutions that got us here.
		So this will by the nature of the audience in this room, explain how Git works.

		Also, I'm trying purely to focus on the trade-offs made by the model that each system uses. At a mid-level.
		So, not talking about centralised vs distributed centrally. This is about the models that Git and Perforce use
		<em>specifically</em>. But I'm not going to focus on things like UI or other implementation details.

	<section>
		<h3>Helix (Perforce)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Centralized</li>
			<li>Have to "check" files "out"</li>
			<li>File modifications grouped into changelists&#42;</li>
			<li>If no one else has edited those files can "check in"</li>
			<li>Centralized server keeps revisions of every file in terms of these changelist changes&#42;</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			I will keep this brief, as I hope you know that basics of it. I'm also trying not to be too specific in how perforce works, the central theme is that Perforce uses a centralised model, and most of the things listed follow from that.

			Asterisk thing is kind of perforce specific
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Consequences of Perforce's Model</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Project history tracked in one place</li>
			<li>Central system knows who is working on which file&#42;</li>
			<li>Software needs Perforce integration&#42;</li>
			<li>Can't work when offline</li>
			<li>Branches are expensive</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			Asterisk is perforce-specific, and not always true (can make files readonly).

			None of these are good/bad per-se, but can have positive and negative properties.

<!-- Explain Git -->

<section>
	<section>
		<h3>What is Git?</h3>
			<p>Git is a <strong>Source</strong> Control Management system</p>
			<p>Developed by Linus Torvalds because he couldn't find a version control system that was:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Distributed</li>
				<li>Performant</li>
				<li>Secure</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So how does it work?</p>
		<aside class="notes">The Source is important, as it was designed for managing code.</aside>
		<!-- TODO: Good Source https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F  -->
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Centralized VCS</h3>
		<img src="img/centralized.png" alt="Diagram of Centralized version control">
		<!-- <p>Without version control all you have is a workspace. Your project in the state it would be if it was just edited and update in a file-system as-is.</p>
		<p>What problems would you face working in such an environment?</p> -->
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Distributed VCS</h3>
		<img src="img/distributed.png" alt="Diagram of Distributed version control" width="400px">
		<!-- <p>Without version control all you have is a workspace. Your project in the state it would be if it was just edited and update in a file-system as-is.</p>
		<p>What problems would you face working in such an environment?</p> -->
		<aside class="notes">
			Normally the hardest bit to grasp about Git, but it's good to show you the end-goal, and work towards it from there.
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Local Version Control</h3>
		<p>You want to be able to keep track of logical changes to your code locally, and be secure that those changes you put in are the changes that come out.</p>
		<img src="img/local.png" alt="Diagram of Local Version Control" width="300px">
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Guaranteeing Security</h3>
		<p>Hash Everything!</p>
		<p>Side Benefit: Content Addressable Data.</p>
		<p>This is <em>fundamental</em> to how Git works.</p>
		<p>Cannot modify history!</p>

		<aside class="notes">
			What is hashed?
			Git Author, Time of Commit, Commit Message, the snapshot of the working directory at the time of modification, and the hashes of any parent commits.
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>A commit is <em>just</em> a hash</h3>
		<img src="img/data-model-3.png" width="400px" alt="Diagram of Git's Hashing Model">
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Branching?</h3>
		<p>A branch is <em>just</em> a file containing a single hash value</p>
		<img src="img/advance-master.png" alt="Diagram of branching" width="500px">
		<p>Super-Duper cheap!</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Merging?</h3>
		<p>Find most recent common commit of two branches, take the content of everything at that point-in-time and do a three-way merge.</p>
		<p>A merge commit is the same as any-other, it just has two parent commits instead of one.</p>
		<p>Git is <em>good</em> at merging.</p>
		<aside class="notes">Some people have gone to extreme lengths to use Git on projects where they are forced to use other vcs systems. Like locally using Git and then manually merging their changes into a subversion repo.</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Implementation?</h3>
		<p>All of this data is simply stored in a `.git` at the root of your workspace, that is an <em>entire</em> Git repository.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Collaboration?</h3>
		<p>Other people simply have their own git repositories that they commit data to, sharing code is simply a matter of merging each-other's branches.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Remotes</h3>
		<p>The concept of a "central" server is extremely useful, especially for collaboration.</p>
		<p><em>But</em> it is nothing special, just another Git repo.</p>
		<p>You can merge changes down from it into your branches by <em>pulling</em>.</p>
		<p>You can apply your changes onto it's branches by <em>pushing</em>.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Remotes (cont.)</h3>
		<p>A remote is simply a URI with a name, by default when you <em>clone</em> a remote your repository will be configured to have remote named <em>origin</em> which points to it.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Merging from a remote</h3>
		<p>Git just stores content of remote branches on your PC when you fetch like any other, can merge them into your branches like you would any other.</p>
		<img src="img/remote-branches-3.png" alt="Showing Fetching from a Remote" width="500px">
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Workflow</h3>
		<p>Git has the concept of something called "the index", a way of <em>staging</em> your changes before committing them to your branch history.</p>
		<img src="img/areas.png" alt="Image of git staging areas" width="400px">
		<p>Once you are happy with what you have staged you can <em>commit</em> everything to your repository.</p>
	</section>

<!-- Now cover tradeoffs of Git -->

<section>
	<section>
		<h3>Git</h3>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Performance: NOT "The same thing but faster"</h3>
		<p>This is a point that Linus Torvalds stresses when talking about Git, especially with regards to branching.</p>
		<p>Cheap and fast branches change the way you use them completely.</p>

		<aside class="notes">
			So imagine hypothetically you are working on a bunch of changes, and they start getting a bit bigger than you thought they would. 

			So, you think "maybe I should create a stream at this point".

			So, what does this involve?
			<ol>
				<li>You go to server GUI to make a stream</li>
				<li>Get drop down options for different kinds of stream, you hope you pick the right one</li>
				<li>You try to switch stream, but perforce shouts at you about having files checked-out</li>
				<li>You start to shelve the files, but then realise you will get weird merge-conflicts if you do that...</li>
				<li>So you get latest on the current branch, spend some time resolving the changes</li>
				<li>Delete currently shelved files, re-shelve just in case</li>
				<li>Also, don't forget to make sure everything you want to work on in the new stream is in the right changelist!</li>
				<li>Switch streams, "populate" the stream whatever that means, wait for server to finish (again)...</li>
				<li>Revert files</li>
				<li>Try to unshelve files</li>
				<li>Have to pick the right mapping, the default doesn't work sometimes for some reason, work-out what the right value is to set...</li>
				<li>Unshelve fails, because when you reverted your changes, you forgot to delete the new files you made</li>
				<li>Reconsile offline work</li>
				<li>Delete files</li>
				<li>Reconsile again just in case</li>
				<li>Unshelve</li>
				<li>Safe automatic merge resolve</li>
				<li>Breathe</li>
			</ol>

			So remember when you create a branch in git, all it needs to know about that branch is which the hash of the latest commit, it can leave your workspace and index as-is, just checks-out that a new branch.

			All it does is create 6 bytes locally.

		<h3>Branch and Merge, Early and Often</h3>
		<p>You can only merge files once committed! If you mess-up the merge there is no way of losing the un-merged data as it's all hashed and verified in the Git history!</p>
		<p>It does completely change the way you work.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Git is awesome right???</h3>
		<p>It is, for text files...</p>
		<p>Not for binary files... 😔</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>The costs of binary in Git</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Entire history on each "client"</li>
			<li>Hard to diff</li>
			<li>No ability to lock files</li>
			<li>Good luck merging them...</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
</section>

<section>
	<section>
	<h3>Git LFS</h3>
	<img src="img/git-lfs.png" alt="Diagram of Git LFS">
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Binary Files Stored on Central Server</h3>
		<p>Git Repository just contains files with indices to these files.</p>
		<p>Various hooks and filters automatically replace these with the actual files when you check anything out...</p>
		<p>And commit hooks automatically do the inverse when you commit...</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Gains and losses</h3>
		<p>Binary data has all positives and negatives of Centralized VCS (can lock!).</p>
		<p>Code has <em>many</em> of the benefits of DVCS.</p>
		<p>There are also other things I personally prefer that Git does unrelated to it being decentralized (don't have to check-out files).</p>

	<h3>Is Git the Future in Games?</h3>
	<p>Things seem to be trending that way, but three big challenges remain...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Useability</li>
		<li>Scalability</li>
		<li>Maturity</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What problem are we trying to solve?</h3>
	<p>There is a class of software that we like to put into the same bucket, obstenisbly because they "solve" the same problems.</p>
	<p>Examples include Helix (Perforce), Subversion, Mercurial and Git.</p>
	<p>So, what problems do they solve?</p>
	<p>Are the they actually same problems?</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Version Control: The Problem</h3>
	<p>If you didn't have a version control system, what problems would you face trying to develop a project as a team, and how would you solve them?</p>
	<p>I will be talking purely about "code" as this is what VCS systems were originally designed for. Art and other assets will be covered later.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Sharing a code base</h3>
	<p>How can we share a code base amongst a team?</p>
	<p>Upload and download source files to/from a file share.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Managing lost data</h3>
	<p>This needs to be done.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Subversion, Helix</h3>
	<p>If you look at the problem of code/asset sharing first, and then the problem of versioning later, the "centralised" model makes a lot of sense.</p>
