Even though they solve similar problems, Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) like Git use a fundamentally different model for managing source code compared to Centralised Version Control Systems we are familiar with in the games industry such as Helix (Perforce). However, many of their advantages in usability, simplicity and robustness have allowed them to dominate the software industry over the last 10 years with one notable exception: the games industry. This talk explains the model Git uses for managing source code, to give a grounded understanding for interacting with it through any interface. The goal will be for everyone to understand why Git has becomes so popular, in addition to the barriers it still faces in being adopted into the games industry.


Why now? Despite the problems Git faces, the advantages of using it for managing source code has led to multiple efforts to create systems which would allow it to be used in the context of game creation. However, this comes at the cost of an increase in complexity. This talk will look at what these efforts are aiming to do and pose the question: would that complexity be worth it?
